AR- Smart Campus Navigation. React-based web application that helps students and visitors navigate a campus

As part of the HIT: "projects for the industry program", I helped create a web application that assists visitors when visiting a campus. The application consists of an interactive map, buildings with a QR code, pop-ups with images of key locations and their description, user authentication and an speaking avatar.

Technologies such as React, NodeJS, Figma and Three.js were used. Original branch: https://github.com/ChenZalman/AR---Smart-Campus-Navigation
